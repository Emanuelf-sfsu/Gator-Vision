## Introduction
San Francisco State University is a public institution that utilizes a variety of methods to expose new/existing students to information about art, facilities, events, etc.
However, there still seems to be a gap in the information. Tools such
as social media, virtual tours, and in-person tours help visitors learn
about the campus generally. But certain, resources or key marker
landmarks remain a mystery to even graduating seniors. In this
paper, I will be exploring the method of using a phone camera and
machine learning to identify specific art pieces located throughout
the campus.
