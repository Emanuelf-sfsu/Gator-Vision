    "To perform transfer learning using MobileNet for mobile statue identification, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of images containing different statues. Aim for a diverse and representative dataset that covers various angles, lighting conditions, and statue types.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training. This typically involves resizing the images to a consistent size, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load Pretrained MobileNet**: Import the MobileNet model with pre-trained weights from a deep learning library such as TensorFlow or Keras. Exclude the top (classification) layer of the model, as you'll replace it with your own custom output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Extraction**: Use the pre-trained MobileNet as a feature extractor. Pass the images from your dataset through the MobileNet model and extract the output from one of the intermediate layers. This will give you a fixed-size feature vector for each input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Custom Output Layer**: Add a new custom output layer on top of the MobileNet architecture. This output layer should have the appropriate number of nodes to match the number of statue classes you want to identify. Use an activation function suitable for multi-class classification, such as softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Training**: Train the model on your dataset. Freeze the layers of the MobileNet base model and only train the parameters of the newly added output layer. Use an appropriate optimizer and loss function for multi-class classification, such as categorical cross-entropy. Iterate over the training data for multiple epochs, monitoring the validation accuracy to ensure the model is learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Fine-Tuning (Optional)**: If you have a large dataset or want to further improve the model's performance, you can consider fine-tuning. Unfreeze some of the layers in the MobileNet base model and continue training the entire model with a lower learning rate. This allows the model to adapt to your specific dataset while retaining the learned features from the pre-training.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset to measure its performance. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess how well the model identifies statues.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Inference**: Use the trained model for inference on new, unseen images. Pass the images through the model and interpret the output probabilities to identify the predicted statue class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of layers to fine-tune, to achieve the best performance for your specific statue identification task."
